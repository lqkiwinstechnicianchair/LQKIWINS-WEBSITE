          For example, at our Walk, Run, Read 5K event, she was eager to help the
          event coordinators unload their trucks and took the initiative to cheer
          on runners even though there was only her and a couple of other people

          social with FV KIWIN'S and was very open and socialble to people from both
          schools. He always attends events with such spirit and good attitude and
          isn't afraid to ask questions. As a sophomore, he displays such dedication,

          rides, which was extremely helpful because we were short on rides. She
          always offered to help when the event coordinators needed assistance, and
          she made an effort to talk to everyone! She was definitely a model member

      <p class="left">Between 1973 and 1974, past California-Nevada-
      Hawaii (CNH) Kiwanis District Governor Sid Smith
      wanted his daughters to have the option to join a
      service organization. Key Club was the only one
      existing at that time, but they weren't able to join
      because it was an all-male club. Smith wanted his
      girls to have the same opportunities as men so he
      started a club called Keyettes.</p>

      <img src="./assets/images/keywanettes.webp">
      <p class="left">The name was changed to "Keywanettes" in the
        mid-70s because a women's organization on the
        east coast already had the rights to the name. It
        was through the efforts of the Cal-Nev-Ha district
        Kiwanis Sponsored Youth Advisors and high school
        principals that a program be made available to the
        young women of the community that provides the
        opportunities that young men had in Key Club.

      <img src="./assets/images/districts.webp">
      <p class="left">In the beginning, Keywanettes was the fastest
        growing high school organization in the nation. There
        used to be four districts: Texas, West Virginia, the
        Carolinas, and CNH. However, the Texas, Virginia,
        and Carolinas District district merged with the Key
        Club District. Since CNH was so strong, and there
        was a need for both organizations, CNH remained
        the only District with both. </p>

      <p class="left">Keywanettes became KIWIN'S when the House of <br>
        Delegates convened at the 1995 CNH Convention. <br>
        KIWIN'S comes from the Otchipew language and <br>
        translates to "people, men and women, working <br>
        together in service." The Cal-Nev-Ha District <br>
        changed their name to dispel gender specific <br>
        connotations and promote growth. </p>

      <p class="lower-left">In 2001 at the District Convention in Woodland <br>
        Hills, CA, we made even greater strides when we <br>
        were adopted into Key Club International as the <br>
        Cal-Nev-Ha KIWIN'S 32nd District of Key Club <br>
        International. We became the first ever District to <br>
        share boundaries with another District, CNH. </p>
      <div class="upper-right">
        <p>Even though we do have unique situation as we <br>
          share boundaries with CNH, we are all part of the <br>
          same overarching organization, working toward <br>
          similar goals. So yes, we are all Key Clubbers. <br>
          But at the same time, we do maintain a unique <br>
          culture--as most Districts do– that is extremely <br>
          unique from that of CNH or any other District.
